Super Referral is an app designed to help people get jobs from referrals. 
Anyone can initiate a paied referral request, which then be reposted by his friend on the app until the 
referral request is accepted by a candidate, then the poster and the candidate enters into chat. 
On successful placement, the poster will pay people along the referral chain to referral bonus, 
based on their distance to the final candidate.
